# spacemacs
This is my current config for spacemacs. Most of it is python/c++ specific changes, a handful of packages I found useful beyond what was already provided, and a lot of styling specific tweaks. One of my biggest gripes with emacs was it looked old. VS Code/Sublime/Atom/<Insert new editor here> look awesome, while emacs looks like emacs. doom-emacs provides a ton of styling updates, so I popped in a few of the packages (doom-themes/doom-modeline) and probably other things and made it look like a modern editor. 

I've also added a sql layer thats specific to my workflow for working with postgres that allows me to globally send regions to a sql buffer and execute a lot of the embedded queries within the codebase I work from.
